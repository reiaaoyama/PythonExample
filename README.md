# PythonExample
This is my git + python sand box for playing on GitHub.

# What can you find here?
You can find all kind of my snippets. Some of the code I found them in
the vast Internet. Some of them I put it here just to make a note out of
it. Most of these snippets are experimental.
- hello.py - This is the "Hello World" example - very simple indeed
- hellopkg.py - A demonstration of python package. Put the print() function in its own package.
